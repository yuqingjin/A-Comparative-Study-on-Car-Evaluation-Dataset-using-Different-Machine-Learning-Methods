You should change the path of loading data when running our code. When run naiveBayes.r, KNN.r, logisticRegression.r and svmC.r,
please change the path in preprocessing.r which is in each method's folder. For other methods, just change the path of corresponding
file. Thanks

Data set is in data folder, named car.data

Instruction for running our code:
1. run naiveBayes.r in naiveBayes folder to see result using naiveBayes method.
2. run MLPNN.r in MLPNN folder to see result using MLPNN method.
3. run KNN.r in KNN folder to see result using KNN method.
4. run logisticRegression.r in logistic folder to see result using logistic regression method.
5. run svmC.r in svm folder to see result using support vector machine method.
6. run dtrf.r in tree folder to see result using decision tree and random forest method.
7. run datavisulation.r in data_visual folder to see result of our data visulization.
